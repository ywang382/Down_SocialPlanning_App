The purpose of this repository is to create and implement the Down App as
defined in the first part of the semester.

Down is a easy-to-use, fast, and efficient social planning app. It is an interface that encourages spontaneous interaction with people around you in your community. We focus on "more fun and less wait" and strive to make event planning, whether informal or formal, a stress-free process. With the Down app, we eliminates overhead in social planning and lets our users get plannings done in a matter of seconds.
