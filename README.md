The purpose of this repository is to create and implement the Down App as
defined in the first part of the semester.

Down is a easy-to-use, fast, and efficient social planning app. It is an interface that encourages spontaneous interaction with people around you in your community. We focus on "more fun and less wait" and strive to make event planning, whether informal or formal, a stress-free process. With the Down app, we eliminates overhead in social planning and lets our users get plannings done in a matter of seconds.

Tech Stack:
The intial version of the app is implemented in Android and available in the Google Play store. Our backend system is primarily written in java with secure connection to firebase database, which is our non-relational database and credentials authentication service for the majority of our user interactions and information, including user data and sign-in credentials. Our service-oriented architecture improves our ability to scale as needed when our user base grows.
